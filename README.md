# Workspace Profiles - Support

Thank you for using Workspace Profiles! This page provides support information, answers to frequently asked questions, and guidance on how to report issues.

## What is Workspace Profiles?

Workspace Profiles is a powerful menu bar utility for macOS designed to automate your display and audio device configurations. Stop wasting time in System Settings every time you connect or disconnect your devices. Create profiles for each of your setups, and let the app switch to the right one instantly either manually, with a keyboard shortcut, or automatically when a device is connected.

## Key Features

* **Create Unlimited Profiles:** Configure your display arrangement (main screen, extended, or mirror) and select your default audio input/output devices for any situation.

* **Automatic Triggers:** Assign profiles to specific devices. The app will detect when a device is connected and apply the correct profile automatically.

* **System-Wide Hotkeys:** Assign custom keyboard shortcuts to your favorite profiles for lightning-fast switching without using your mouse.

* **Manual Control:** All your profiles are always accessible from the menu bar for quick manual switching.

* **Lightweight & Native:** A small, efficient utility that feels right at home on your Mac.


## Getting Started: How to Use

Setting up your first automated profile is easy:

1. **Create a Profile:**

* Click the Workspace Profiles icon in the menu bar and select "Settings", and then "Profiles".

* Click the + button to add a new profile and give it a name (e.g., "Work Dock", "Home Office").

2. **Configure Displays & Audio:**

* With the new profile selected, choose your desired Primary Display from the dropdown list.

* Select whether you want your displays in Extended or Mirror mode.

* Choose your preferred Audio Input (microphone) and Audio Output (speakers/headphones) devices for this profile.

3. **Set Up an Automatic Trigger (The Magic!):**

* Go to the "Triggers" part.

* Click the + button to add a new trigger.

* From the "Add Display/Audio trigger" dropdown, select the monitor or audio device that should activate a profile.

* From the Workspace Profiles icon in the menu bar dropdown, select the profile you created in step 1.

* That's it! The next time you connect that specific device, your profile will be applied automatically.

4. **( Optional) Assign a Hotkey:**

* In the "Profiles" tab, click inside the "Hotkey" field next to your profile.

* Press the key combination you want to use (e.g., ⌃ + ⌥ + 1).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*Q: The app isn't switching automatically when I plug in my monitor.*

A: An automatic switch only happens if you have created a Trigger. A Profile by itself will only work for manual or hotkey switching. Please make sure you have created a trigger in the "Triggers" tab that links your specific device to a profile.

*Q: Can the app turn off my external monitor?*

A: No. The app manages display arrangements (which screen is primary, and whether they are extended or mirrored). It does not have the ability to turn off the power or video signal to a monitor, as this is a function controlled deeply by macOS.

*Q: My audio device or display is not appearing in the settings.*

A: Please ensure your device is fully connected and recognized by macOS before opening the profile configuration window. If it's a Bluetooth device, make sure it is paired and active.

*Q: How do I update the app?*

A: All updates are managed directly through the Mac App Store. Simply open the App Store, go to the "Updates" section, and update the app if a new version is available.
