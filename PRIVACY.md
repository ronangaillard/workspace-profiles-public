# Privacy Policy for Workspace Profiles

_Effective Date: September 1, 2025_

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains what information Workspace Profiles (the "app") handles and why. Our core principle is simple: your data is yours, and it never leaves your computer.

## No Data Collection

Workspace Profiles is designed with your privacy as a top priority.

**No Internet Connection:** The application does not connect to the internet. It cannot and does not send any data to us or any third party.

**No User Data is Collected:** We do not collect, store, track, or transmit any personal information or data about your usage. The app does not include any analytics, user tracking, or advertising frameworks.

**Local Storage Only:** All data created by the app, such as your saved profiles, trigger configurations, and settings, is stored exclusively on your local Mac. This data never leaves your device and is entirely under your control. You can delete this data at any time by uninstalling the application.

## Permissions

To provide its core functionality, Workspace Profiles may request certain permissions from macOS, such as "Accessibility" or "Automation". These permissions are required by the operating system to allow the app to manage your display and audio settings as you configure them.

These permissions are used solely for the app's intended features and are not used to monitor your activity or collect any data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
